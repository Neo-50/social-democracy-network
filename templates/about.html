        <p><strong>Social Democracy Network</strong> is an independent platform for democratic activism, 
            protest coverage, and community-led news discussion. We aim to support grassroots efforts, 
            connect like-minded individuals, and provide a safe space for political expression.</p>

        <p>We are not affiliated with any political party or organization. 
            The goal is to promote justice, human rights, and participatory democracy through open dialogue and real-world organizing.</p>

        <p>ðŸ’¬ What is Matrix?</p>

        <p>Matrix is a secure, decentralized messaging network used by governments, universities, open source communities, and privacy advocates around the world.
            Unlike Signal or WhatsApp, Matrix isnâ€™t owned by a company. Itâ€™s a protocol â€” more like email â€” where anyone can run a server and participate. Your data stays under your control.
            The French government, the German military, and organizations like Mozilla and KDE use Matrix to coordinate and communicate privately.
            Here on the Social Democracy Network, we use Matrix to host public discussions, organize events, and build long-term community spaces without relying on Big Tech. 
            Our servers are hosted in Switzerland, where strong privacy laws help protect user rights and data sovereignty.</p>
